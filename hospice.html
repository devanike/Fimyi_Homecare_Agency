                        <p><strong>Palliative care & hospice care</strong> is specialized care for people with serious or terminal illnesses. The support focuses on providing relief from the symptoms, pain and stress of a serious illness and improves quality of life. The goal is to improve the quality of life for both the patient and their family whilst reducing the emotional effects of illnesses such as heart failure and colon cancer.</p>
                        <p>While some people receive palliative support within an inpatient hospice or residential nursing home, palliative care at home is becoming a popular choice for many individuals who want to stay in an environment where they feel most comfortable. It is similar to hospice care at home.</p>

                        <h3>Benefits of palliative care at home</h3>
                        <p>One of the main benefits of palliative care at home is that it allows somebody to spend their time at home, in the company of someone they know and trust whilst receiving end of life care. As well as being reassuring for the person receiving care, knowing this can give peace of mind to families and close friends too. Not having care in a hospital or hospice also means less disruption for everybody: it’s usually easier for friends and family to visit at a person’s home. Round-the-clock care allows any changes in condition to be noticed and responded to quickly. Family members can carry on with their lives, knowing they will be notified of any developments. You can also be reassured that the person providing care is assessed to the high standards.</p>

                <h3>The Options for Palliative Home Care</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Live-in care</strong>: Live-in care places a specially trained live-in carer that will support each day according to your requirements. Carefully chosen, based on your personality and care needs, this caregiver will live with you at home, supporting with your day-to-day needs. With a special focus on promoting your independence and helping you to get the most out of life, he or she is likely to become a great friend and companion.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Regular home visits</strong>: If you’d prefer support visits at specific times of the day – or overnight – we will support you with this. From just an hour visit each week all the way through to several visits a day or nightly support. An expertly trained caregiver can support you to stay independent at home.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Respite care</strong>: If your usual family caregiver needs to take a break, we offer respite live-in care from as little as three days. If you’ve been let down by your usual caregiver, or they are taken ill suddenly, we can step in quickly to support you with emergency care.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How quickly can palliative care givers be arranged?</h3>
                <p>When somebody is ill, conditions can change very quickly. The need to arrange palliative care can be very urgent, especially if someone’s in pain or distress.</p>
                <p>We offer emergency home care for a variety of circumstances and in many cases. Even if you are currently in the hospital or another residential setting, our dedicated care manager can arrange support that will ease your move back to the home that you know, even when life threatening illnesses such as advanced cancer are concerned. Please call us if you’d like to discuss the options. Our team is available 24/7. In many instances, we can arrange for support to start within as little as 24 hours.</p>
